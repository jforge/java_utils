java_utils
==========

Utility code for Java projects, accumulated over several projects.

This is currently being reviewed and cleaned up.

A more detailed README is to be done.

The git repository contains four Eclipse projects:

  * 01_utils: Generic utility classes
  * 01_utils_logging: Utility classes for logging  
  * 01_utils_with_jdom: Utility classes that use org.jdom datastructures
  * 01_utils_other: Utility classes that use other 3rd-party packages (most of these don't compile yet)
