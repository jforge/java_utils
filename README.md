java_utils
==========

Utility code for Java projects, accumulated over several projects.

This is currently being reviewed and cleaned up, so things may not compile and there may be messes.

A more detailed README is to be done.

The git repository contains three Eclipse projects:

  * 01_utils: Generic utility classes. Needs the following external jar files:
     * jul-to-slf4j.jar (from SLF4J)
     * slf4j-api.jar (from SLF4J)
     * logback-classic.jar (from LOGBACK)
     * logback-core.jar (from LOGBACK)
  * 01_utils_with_jdom: Utility classes that use org.jdom datastructures
     * jdom.jar (from JDOM)
     * slf4j-api.jar (from SLF4J)
  * 01_utils_other: Utility classes that use other 3rd-party packages (most of these don't compile yet)
     * ....
