 * An 'exponentially decaying average over time' is computed; the average is
 * recomputed every time a new measurement is offered, i.e. every time 
 * measure() is called.
 * 
 * We just have to remember 1) The average obtained at the last measurement
 *                          2) When the last measurement was made (t)
 * 
 * Given:    average     = the last average obtained at time t
 *           value       = a new measurement obtained at time dt
 *           kappa(dt)   = a weighting factor that depends on dt
 *           
 * We compute the new average as a weighted sum:
 * 
 *           average    := value * (1-kappa) + average * kappa
 * 
 * To exponentially discount the old average, kappa is computed as
 * 
 *           kappa       = e^(dt * ln(fi)) = fi^dt in [0,1]
 *           
 * Where fi in [0,1] is a constant that expresses the decay speed.
 * 
 * If dt= 1 second, then kappa = fi
 * 
 * If dt -> 0   , then kappa -> 1 (all the weight lies with the old average)
 * If dt -> +oo , then kappa -> 0 (all the weight lies with the new valze)
 * 
 * In this case, we are working with discrete time intervals (milliseconds).
 * So it can happen that two values are observed in the same millisecond, 
 * and the second reevaluation will indeed have dt = 0. It would then be
 * disregarded. 
 * 
 * Instead, we are applying a correction:
 * 
 * If value a was observed and then value b was observed in the same
 * millisecond, then the evaluation would have giveb:
 * 
 *           average    := (a + b) * (1-kappa) + average * kappa
 *                       = (a * (1-kappa) + average * kappa) + b * (1 - kappa)
 *                       = first_computed_average + correction
 *                       
 * So we just add b * (1 - kappa) to the average first computed.
 *                       
 * 2003.09.24 - First release
 * 2004.06.21 - Added to String() 
 * 2004.06.22 - This things seems to be programmed wrong? No, it's just the
 *              commentary that is wrong. Add the possibility to have 
 *              varying decay rate.
 * 2005.03.21 - Warning for negative dt in 'measure' made less shocking.
 *              I.e. we don't stack trace. And indeed, it may happen that
 *              dt < 0 if NTP sets the clock back
 * 2005.11.18 - Reused for integration into AlphaAppender (code copy). Internal
 *              Log4J logging removed. Package visible only. 
 * 2006.02.12 - Simplified. Can now have two measurements at the same millisecond.
 *              Checked math. Subtle problem where > 1 measurements occur in the
 *              same millisecond fixed.
 * 2009.08.26 - Class moved to a new, separate package - com.mplify.log4jlogging
 * 2009.08.28 - Unified with the TimeDecayingAverage of com.mplify.helpers,
 *              which was a copy with an additional measure() and has now been
 *              deleted
