 * An 'exponentially decaying average *rate* over time' (in Hz, of course) is
 * computed; the average rate is recomputed every time a new measurement is 
 * offered, i.e. every time measure() is called.
 * 
 * 2003.09.24 - First release
 * 2004.06.21 - Added to String(), fixed stupid bullshit error that computed
 *              dx/dt where dx depended on a never initialized value. Beurk!
 * 2005.11.18 - Reused for integration into AlphaAppender (code copy). Internal 
 *              calls to Log4J removed. Package visible only.
 * 2006.02.12 - Simplified. Can now have two measurements at the same millisecond.
 *              Revised math.
 * 2009.08.28 - Unified with the TimeDecayingRateAverage of com.mplify.helpers
